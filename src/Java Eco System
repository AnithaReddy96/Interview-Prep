Java works on the principle of WRITE ONCE RUN ANYWHERE. Once a Java program is written it gets compiled into byte code.
This byte code can run on any platform(OS) like windows,linux,mac.
Different operating systems and hardware architectures have JVMs custom designed for themselves and all JVMs can run the same bytecode.


Java API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities that comes prepackaged with the Java development kit. It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces known as packages.

These APIs enable Java programs to access the local file system, the network and other basic functionality which one would otherwise have had to program oneself. These APIs cut down development time.

The standard Java APIs come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or with the Java SDK which also includes a JRE.

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) includes the Java Virtual Machine and the standard Java APIs (core classes and supporting files.). The JRE contains just enough to execute a Java application, but not to compile it.

The Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK) is JRE plus the Java compiler, and a set of other tools.
